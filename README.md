# stable-Multiplayer-Lobby-Finder
Script that stores and shows (in the terminal) all fetched and ongoing stable multiplayer lobbies


Things to note: 

Youll need to create two (2) oauth applications. Name doesn't matter. No need to put callback urls. Only thing you are going to need is the client id and client secret; DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES GIVE THIS OUT, IT IS ESSENTIALLY THE USERNAME AND PASSWORD OF YOUR ACCOUNT. 

- When launching the .exe you'll need to have the client IDs and client secrets on hand, and when prompted please put them in, DO NOT CLOSE THE TERMINAL, it will CLOSE THE PROGRAM. (Im still working on that).

- Once the credentials are filled you shouldn't have to reestablish them unless you delete the config folder. This can be added to a folder by creating a `New Folder` -> `Rename to your preference` -> Drag `multiScript.exe` and `Config` folder into those folders -> `Create a shortcut to the multiScript.exe` then you should be okay to run.

If you have any difficulties you can DM Blushing on discord or through osu!.
